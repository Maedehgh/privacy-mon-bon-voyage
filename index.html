    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 8, 2026</p>

    <p>
      Mon Bon Voyage values your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how information is
      collected, used, and protected when you use the Mon Bon Voyage mobile application.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Location data (optional):</strong> If you grant permission, location access
        may be used to show your position on the map and help start routes from your
        current location.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>App usage data:</strong> Basic, anonymous usage information may be used
        to improve app performance and user experience.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>
      Information is used only to provide core app features such as trip planning,
      map functionality, and improving overall usability.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      Mon Bon Voyage uses third-party services such as Google Maps to display maps and
      locations. Payments and subscriptions are processed securely by Apple through the
      App Store. These services may collect information as governed by their own privacy
      policies.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
      Trip data and preferences are stored locally on your device or using Apple-provided
      services. We do not operate our own external servers for storing personal user data.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
    <p>
      Premium subscriptions are handled entirely by Apple. Mon Bon Voyage does not
      collect or have access to your payment information.
    </p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Mon Bon Voyage does not knowingly collect personal information from children
      under the age of 13. If you believe that such information has been collected,
      please contact us so we can remove it.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
    <p>
      You can manage or revoke app permissions, including location access, through
      your device settings. Subscriptions can be managed through your Apple ID.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected
      on this page with an updated revision date.
    </p>
